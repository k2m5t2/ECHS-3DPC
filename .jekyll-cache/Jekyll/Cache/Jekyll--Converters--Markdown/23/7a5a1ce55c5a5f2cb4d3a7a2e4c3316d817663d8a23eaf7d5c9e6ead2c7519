			<h2>What Do You Mean Exactly?</h2>
		</header>
		<p>3D printing is definitely a topic with a <b>potential to get everyone excited.</b> However, we figured that running a school club to promote 3D printing without a larger competition or group (ie. Science Olympiad, Mu Alpha Theta) is a <b>demanding challenge.</b> <br /> <br />
		For our school, we see the 3D Printing Club as a <b>community to fulfill non-academic passion for our students</b>, especially our STEM students too, since engineering classes and extracurriculars are not offered in our school. <br />
		For others, we want the 3D Printing Club to be an <b>open experiment</b>, figuring out what works and what doesn't work to get people excited and initiate a successful and passion-driven engineering community. </p>
		<p>Our master plan is to <b>initiate, grow, and maintain the 3D Printing Club for a successful year, then document our experience to help anyone interested a little in recreating our adventures. 
		</b></p>

					<h3>Monday, January 20: Da Vinci Jr. Disassembly</h3>
				</header>
				<p>We decided that the 3 Da Vinci Jr. are pretty much useless as of now, since they require the use
				proprietary software which has gone obsolete. <br />
				However, they still make very capable hardware, with decent build volume too ((codify)180 mm ^3).
				Therefore, we will be converting their motherboard with SKR v1.3 (put href), a feature-packed motherboard
				with 32-bit processing chip and Trinamic stepper motor drivers known to eliminate motor heat &amp; noise. 
				Today, we will be dissecting two Da Vincis and try to figure out how we will work with the wiring.
