			<h2>What Do You Mean Exactly?</h2>
		</header>
		<p>3D printing is definitely a topic with a <b>potential to get everyone excited.</b> However, we figured that running a school club to promote 3D printing without a larger competition or group (ie. Science Olympiad, Mu Alpha Theta) is a <b>demanding challenge.</b> <br /> <br />
		For our school, we see the 3D Printing Club as a <b>community to fulfill non-academic passion for our students</b>, especially our STEM students too, since engineering classes and extracurriculars are not offered in our school. <br />
		For others, we want the 3D Printing Club to be an <b>open experiment</b>, figuring out what works and what doesn't work to get people excited and initiate a successful and passion-driven engineering community. </p>
		<p><b>Our master plan is to initiate, grow, and maintain the 3D Printing Club for a successful year, then document our results and summary so our adventure can be recreated 
		(hopefully) anywhere in the world. </b></p>
